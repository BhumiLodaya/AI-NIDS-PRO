🛡️ AI-NIDS PRO: Professional Hybrid Threat Analysis

AI-NIDS PRO is an enterprise-grade threat intelligence and Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). It bridges the critical gap between high-level user activity (URLs) and low-level behavioral network telemetry (Flows), utilizing a Random Forest model trained on the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset to detect threats with 99.8% accuracy.

🚀 Overview

In modern cybersecurity, traditional signature-based detection often misses "Zero-Day" exploits. AI-NIDS PRO solves this by focusing on behavioral patterns. By analyzing 78 distinct network flow features—such as packet timing, volume, and protocol specifics—it can identify malicious intent even if the URL or IP has never been seen before.

✨ Features

Modern Security UI – A high-fidelity React dashboard featuring glassmorphism, neon accents, and real-time scanline animations for a professional SOC aesthetic.

Hybrid Analysis Logic – A unique translation layer that resolves Application-Layer URLs into simulated Transport-Layer Network Flows for deep inspection.

Educational Intelligence Layer – Interactive tooltips and sidebars that explain complex NIDS metrics (e.g., Dst Port, Flow Duration, Protocol Flags) for junior analysts.

Context-Aware Risk Assessment – Intelligent scoring logic that suppresses false positives; Benign traffic is always categorized as Low Risk, regardless of model confidence.

Multi-Class Threat Intelligence – Goes beyond binary detection to specifically identify DDoS, Brute Force, Botnets, Infiltration, and Port Scans.

Forensic Audit Logging – Automatic, immutable logging of all detections into threat_logs.csv, recording timestamps, resolved IPs, and confidence scores.

📊 Attack Taxonomy

The system is trained to identify and categorize traffic into seven distinct profiles:

Class

Description

Network Signature

DDoS

Distributed Denial of Service

High packet volume, short duration, flooding patterns.

Brute Force

Credential Cracking

Repetitive small packets, typically targeting Port 22 (SSH) or 80/443.

Bot

Automated Botnet Activity

Persistent heartbeat connections, long durations, specific C2 ports.

Infiltration

Backdoor/Exploit attempts

Stealthy, low packet count, very long durations (data exfiltration).

PortScan

Network Reconnaissance

Sequential or random port probing to find vulnerabilities.

Web Attack

Phishing/Malware sites

URL-based heuristics combined with anomalous download flows.

Benign

Safe/Normal Traffic

Standard handshakes and data transfer patterns.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Backend: Python 3.8+, Flask (REST API), Flask-CORS, Socket.

Machine Learning: Random Forest Classifier, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Joblib.

Frontend: React (18.x), Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons.

Dataset: CSE-CIC-IDS2018 (Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity).

⚙️ How It Works (The Hybrid Pipeline)

The system follows a 5-step analysis pipeline to maintain technical accuracy:

Ingestion (Layer 7): The user provides a URL. The system parses the hostname and resolves it to a physical IP address.

Simulation (The Bridge): Based on the URL's characteristics, the system generates a 78-dimensional network flow vector, mimicking the metadata generated by a real packet sniffer.

ML Inference (The Brain): The vector is normalized using a StandardScaler and passed through the Random Forest model.

Risk Evaluation: The system compares the prediction against "Security Context." If the AI is 99% sure it's "Benign," it is safely labeled as Low Risk. If it detects an attack, the Risk Level is weighted by the confidence score.

Exposition (The UI): The results are rendered with "Security Educator" tooltips, helping the user understand the link between the packets and the threat.

📦 Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher

pip or conda

Step-by-Step Installation

Clone the Repo:

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/AI_Threat_Analysis_NIDS.git](https://github.com/yourusername/AI_Threat_Analysis_NIDS.git)
cd AI_Threat_Analysis_NIDS

Simply open threat_scanner_v4.html in your browser.

📡 API Documentation

POST /analyze

Request Payload:

{
  "url": "[http://target.com/dos-attack](http://target.com/dos-attack)"
}



Successful Response:

{
  "verdict": "MALICIOUS",
  "label": "DDoS",
  "confidence": "0.9245",
  "risk_level": "High",
  "ip": "104.21.65.122",
  "flow_metrics": {

⚠️ Troubleshooting

Backend Connection Failed: Ensure server.py is running and your terminal shows ✅ Model loaded. Check that the port (5000) is not being used by another application.

CORS Errors: The Flask server uses flask-cors. Ensure it is installed via requirements.txt.

Model Accuracy: For the best results, ensure model.pkl and scaler.pkl are located in the models/ directory.

🎯 Future Roadmap

[ ] Live Packet Sniffing: Integrate scapy for real-time traffic analysis.

[ ] Threat Visualization: Add real-time line charts for packet volume tracking.

[ ] SIEM Integration: Export logs directly to Splunk or ELK stack.
